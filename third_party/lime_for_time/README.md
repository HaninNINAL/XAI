# LIME For Time

We applied the LIME algorithm (LIME - Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) developed by Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Sameer Singh and Carlos Guestrin to time series classification. The goal was to explain time series classification algorithms by highlighting the areas of the timeseries used by the classifier in its prediction. That way a user of the classification algorithm can determine if the algorithm can be trusted.
